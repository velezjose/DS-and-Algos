# Common Data Structures and Algorithms Repo

In this repo, you can find the implementations of a wide variety of algorithms and Data Structures that I have been practicing for technical interviews.
(For common graph algorithms, [click here](https://github.com/velezjose/graph-algorithms).)

1. LRUCache –> Implements a Least Recently Used cache with a DoublyLinkedList and a HashMap.
2. Sorting –> common sorting algorithms (merge, quick, radix, ...)
3. LinkedList –> Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List implementation
4. MathEvaluation –> infix notation to RPN, evaluate RPN
5. TowersOfHanoi –> Implement Towers of Hanoi problem for any n number of starting disks
6. Miscellaneous –> miscellaneous implementations of solutions to toy problems
7. UnionFind –> Implements a UnionFind algorithm using 4 different algorithm approaches.
8. Command Line Games –> Tic Tac Toe and Minesweeper
9. Randomized Set –> ADT: put(val) getRandom(val) remove(val) all in O(1) time
10. Search –> binary search and a grep implementation using Rabin-Karp

Stay tuned for more!
